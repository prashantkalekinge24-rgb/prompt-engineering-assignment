Prompt Engineering Assignment — Summary

Project: Single-page site demonstrating prompt-engineering and front-end design.
Tooling: Tailwind CSS (CDN), vanilla JavaScript. Prompts crafted to be reusable across ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude.

Why the prompts are designed this way:
- Long, explicit meta-prompt ensures consistent output across tools and repeated runs.
- Section-specific prompts allow targeted iteration and quick fixes without regenerating the full page.
- Accessibility, semantic HTML, and responsive breakpoints mandated to ensure production-ready outputs.
- Tailwind chosen for concise, readable styling and fast iteration.

Prompts used:
1. META-PROMPT (master instruction) — contains constraints, accessibility, and deliverables.
2. NAV PROMPT, HERO PROMPT, SERVICES PROMPT, FORM PROMPT, FOOTER PROMPT — each section-specific and self-contained.
3. FULL PAGE PROMPT — to assemble all sections in a single file.

How prompts were refined:
- Iteration 1: initial layout and spacing tuned via Tailwind utilities.
- Iteration 2: improved accessibility (aria attributes and keyboard focus).
- Iteration 3: added client-side form validation and success messaging.
Challenges:
- Ensuring consistent visual language across independently generated sections required small tweaks (consistent color tokens, spacing).
- Balancing concise code with production-ready semantics required explicit instructions in the prompt.

Deliverables included:
- Full prompts (META + section prompts).
- Generated single-file HTML (Tailwind + JS) — no manual edits were performed on the provided output.
- Instructions for hosting and recording the process.

Notes:
- Replace placeholder images and brand copy as needed.
- To host: push index.html to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages or drag-and-drop to Netlify for instant publishing.
